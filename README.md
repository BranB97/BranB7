| Jobstreet     | Developed an end-to-end ETL pipeline to process and load data from a dataset containing job information scraped from Jobstreet. The raw data is extracted and transformed using Python (pandas) which is then loaded into a data warehouse (BigQuery). The entire pipeline is orchestrated via Apache Airflow. Lastly, a dashboard is created to visualise the loaded data using Looker Studio.  |               |
